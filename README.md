Overview:

Chef Bartender - 
We developed an app to display food and drink options as per the user's input. The app is a chef and a bartender, and has the knowledge to help take the guess work out of making a delicious meal, or satisfying beverage and the user's behest.
The user should input a food or drink selection, and it will display cards with random recipes having to do with the user's input subject matter.

Description:

Chef Bartender has a search bar in which a user may input their desired food or drink item. Chef Bartender will get to work and display a mutlitude of options within the user's search parameters.
